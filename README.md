# Advent of Code 2019
Have a go yourself [here](https://adventofcode.com/2019).

Did last year's one in python but I was lazy with my coding and the performance was pretty bad.

This year I'm trying to learn Rust by doing these exercises. Performance will be much better and hopefully Rust will force me to think more carefully about what I am doing.
